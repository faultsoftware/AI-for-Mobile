**Export Hugging Face Models to ONNX for iOS and Android**

## Introduction

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides access to thousands of machine learning models. However, running these models locally on your device can be beneficial due to privacy concerns, cost savings, reduced network usage, and faster processing times.

**Why Run a Model Locally?**

Running a model locally offers several advantages:

* **Privacy**: Maintain control over your data.
* **Cost**: Eliminate API costs.
* **Network connection**: Reduce the need for network connectivity.
* **Speed**: Local processing is generally faster.

**Challenges with Running Models Locally**

However, there are challenges to consider:

* **Model size**: Machine learning models can be large and may not fit on a device.
* **Input/output**: Models require specific input data formats and produce output results that need to be processed.

**What Does ONNX Solve?**

[ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) (Open Neural Network Exchange) solves several problems:

* **Model compatibility**: Convert models from various frameworks, including Hugging Face, into a compatible format.
* **Quantization**: Reduce the precision of model weights and activations to make it smaller and more efficient for deployment.
* **Input/output simplicity**: Simplify input/output processing.

**Export to ONNX**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python (Python 3.x)
* Optimum
* ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
* ONNXRuntime
* Hugging Face Transformers library

Install these using pip:
```bash
!pip install optimum onnx onnxruntime transformers
```

Protip: Test these commands in an online Jupyter notebook like [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). For any shell commands, prefix the command with '!'.
